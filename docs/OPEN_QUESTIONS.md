# Open Questions

- How should multi-word verb or noun synonyms from legacy sources be normalized? Current resources require single tokens.
- What is the integration plan for `BeatSchedulerService` with `echo` and `mask` triggers (Chronicle and Mask systems)?
- Should `ParserService` be exposed as an autoload, and what parsing API should it provide to callers?
- What is the expected command or environment to run Godot tests headlessly in CI?

Further guidance is needed for the above items.
