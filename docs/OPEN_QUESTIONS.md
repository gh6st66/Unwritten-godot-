# Open Questions

- Which additional verbs and nouns from `godot/src/` should be prioritized for `.tres` conversion, and who owns the mapping table?
- What test framework (GUT vs GDUnit) and command will be standardized for parser and scheduler tests in CI?
- How should `BeatSchedulerService` interface with Chronicle and Mask systems for `echo`/`mask` triggers, and how is RNG seeded for deterministic picks?
- What is the official headless Godot CLI setup so tests can run locally and in CI?

Further guidance is needed for the above items.
