Here’s a condensed design guide for coders. All theory is boiled down into direct, implementable rules and examples for The Unwritten.

Unwritten – Psychological Design Guidelines (Condensed)
1. Low Ball Technique

Mechanic: Give appealing advantage early → later reveal hidden cost.
Implementation Examples:

Free mask with positive traits → drains resources daily until repaid.
Settlement offers free shelter → authority imposes tribute afterward.




2. Function Before Form

Rule: Every system must reinforce identity, consequence, or legacy.
Implementation Examples:

Masks = alter recognition, NPC reactions, journal claims.
Echoes = reshape future maps, NPC behavior, journal entries.




3. Self-Determination Theory
Competence

Start with small journal claims, escalate to larger ones.
Real-time daily action limits → mastery in pacing and allocation.

Relatedness

NPCs remember which mask player wore.
Echoes create descendants who recall prior player actions.

Autonomy

Event map generates branching paths (pilgrimage, infiltration, retreat).
Dialogue always includes “silence” → doing nothing still has consequences.


4. Manipulation Techniques

Framing: Label NPCs (zealot, traitor) → primes player perception.
Foot in the Door: Small request (1 resource) → escalates to permanent allegiance.
Door in the Face: Large request (sacrifice ally) → fallback smaller request (give up ally’s mask).
Fear then Relief: Impending collapse → temporary reprieve makes harsher conditions easier to accept.
Cognitive Bias: Failed “high chance” rolls redirect into side branches instead of outright loss.
Gambler’s Ruin: Mask market semi-random rolls → guarantee rare trait after repeated failures.


5. Form Follows Legacy

Masks: Ownership persists across runs; traded masks retain permanent provenance.
Echoes: Generate future world states (maps, NPCs, journal claims) based on past player actions.


Would you like me to also map each rule directly to a system file or module (e.g., MaskSystem.ts, JournalEngine.ts) so your dev team has a one-to-one coding reference?
